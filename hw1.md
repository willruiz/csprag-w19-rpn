## Question 1
``` 1
{{ Guest additions are additions inputed from the users original software to help make the connection from the original software to the Virtual Machine. The processing became faster and I should adjust the window size to unrestricted dimensions after downloading Guest Additions. }}
```

## Question 2
``` 2
{{ I am definitely more aligned to "Windows culture." My family has never been very technology/programming focused and none of us have has any experience with the command terminal. Since I've started programming, Umich has been really pushing Unix culture, but I still feel like I'm still aligned with Windows. It only seems that everything I do on a computer that is non-EECS related is still through the Windows GUI. I want to be more Unix orientated, but the transition through the Computer Science program will take more time. }}
```

## Question 3
``` 3
{{ Coding in the real world is built in a way that doesn't just embrace logic and computative thinking, it's built on top of arbitrary scaffolding that has embraced. This scaffolding is the command-line, and it is relatively esoteric. There is that question of should we tear down the status-quo for something better. This problem is found everywhere, normative vs positive. I took away from the articles is that talent and success don't go hand-in-hand. I agree with the second article. The command line is something arbitrary we embrace, but is necessary to embrace. The more you look at everything, nothing is fair and nothing benefits every background equally. But complaining does nothing and the command-line is nevertheless powerful. }}
